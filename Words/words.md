* antithetical - directly opposed or contrasted; mutually incompatible.
Example usage - 
The low-latency user wants Bigtableâ€™s request queues to be (almost always) empty so that the system can process each outstanding request immediately upon arrival.
The user concerned with offline analysis is more interested in system throughput(number of requests served per unit time),
As you can see, success and failure are **antithetical** for these sets of users. Success for the low-latency user is failure for the user concerned with offline analysis.

* ubiquitous - present, appearing, or found everywhere.
Example usage -
Achieved through efficiencies and cost savings by utilizing **ubiquitous** connectivity that is available as commodity hardware and readily available as a service.

* obscure - keep from being seen; conceal.
Example usage -
Most metrics are better thought of as distributions rather than averages. As simple average can obscure these tail latencies

* fallacy - a mistaken belief, especially one based on unsound argument.
Example usage - 
"the notion that the camera never lies is a fallacy"

* axiom - a statement or proposition which is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true.
  "the axiom that sport builds character"
Example Usage - If I really wanted to understand this axiom, I figured, I needed to understand the people who live their lives by it.
