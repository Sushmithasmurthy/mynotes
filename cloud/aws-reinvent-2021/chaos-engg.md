# Chaos Engineering
* Run tests that injects failure
* Experimenting on a softeeware systeem to vuild confidence

# Phases of chaos engineering
Steady state --> Hypotheesis --> Run experiment --> Verify -> Improve --> Steady state

# Aws Fault injection simulator (FIS)
Few Scenarios
* EC2 instance stop
* Stress testing
