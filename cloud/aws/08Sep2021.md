AWS global condition context keys

* When a principal makes a request to AWS, AWS gathers the request information into a request context. You can use the Condition element of a JSON policy to compare keys in the request context with key values that you specify in your policy
* **IfExists**  If you use condition keys that are available only in some circumstances, you can use the IfExists versions of the condition operators. The values are only checked if the specified key is included in the request context.
* Global condition keys are condition keys with an aws: prefix.
