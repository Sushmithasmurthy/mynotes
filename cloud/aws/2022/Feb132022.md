### Security 
The attributes contained in AWS SSO are the basic attributes commonly used across applications. These attributes include information such as first and last name, phone number, email address, address, and preferred language. You might want to consider which applications and which accounts can use this personally identifiable information.

To control access to this information, you have two options. First, you can choose to enable access in only the AWS Organizations management account or in all AWS Organizations accounts. Second, you can use service control policies (SCPs) to control which applications can access the information in which AWS Organizations accounts.

When you enable AWS SSO for the first time, AWS enables use of integrated applications automatically in all AWS Organizations accounts. To constrain applications, you must implement SCPs.
