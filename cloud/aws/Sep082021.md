AWS global condition context keys

* When a principal makes a request to AWS, AWS gathers the request information into a request context. You can use the Condition element of a JSON policy to compare keys in the request context with key values that you specify in your policy
* **IfExists**  If you use condition keys that are available only in some circumstances, you can use the IfExists versions of the condition operators. The values are only checked if the specified key is included in the request context.
* Global condition keys are condition keys with an aws: prefix.
* **aws:CalledVia** Use this key to compare the services in the policy with the services that made requests on behalf of the IAM principal (user or role)
  * The aws:CalledVia key is a multivalued key. However, you can't enforce order using this key in a condition. 
  * **aws:CalledViaFirst**  and **aws:CalledViaLast**
    * For example, assume that AWS CloudFormation calls another service named X Service, which calls DynamoDB, which then calls AWS KMS. The final call to AWS KMS is performed by User 1 via AWS CloudFormation, then X Service, and then DynamoDB. It was first called via AWS CloudFormation and last called via DynamoDB.
