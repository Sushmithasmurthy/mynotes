Definitions:
Permission Sets:
A permission set is a collection of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. Permission sets can contain up to 10 AWS managed policies and a single custom policy stored in AWS SSO

Policy:
A policy is an object that defines a userâ€™s permissions. Policies contain statements that represent individual access controls (allow or deny) for various tasks. This determines what tasks users can or cannot perform within the AWS account. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (a user or role) makes a request.

When you provision a permission set in the AWS account, AWS SSO creates a corresponding IAM role on that account, with a trust policy that allows users to assume the role through AWS SSO. With AWS SSO, you can assign more than one permission set to a user in the specific AWS account. Users who have multiple permission sets must choose one when they sign in through the user portal or the AWS CLI. Users will see these as IAM roles.

Steps:
Step 1:Create permission sets
aws sso-admin create-permission-set --instance-arn '<Instance ARN>' --name 'EC2-S3-FullAccess' --description 'EC2 and S3 access for developers'

aws sso-admin create-permission-set --instance-arn '<Instance ARN>' --name 'AuditAccess' --description 'Audit Access for security team on ExampleOrgDev account'

Step 2: Assign policies to permission sets
aws sso-admin attach-managed-policy-to-permission-set --instance-arn '<Instance ARN>' --permission-set-arn '<Permission Set ARN>' 
--managed-policy-arn 'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/amazonec2fullaccess'

aws sso-admin attach-managed-policy-to-permission-set --instance-arn '<Instance ARN>' --permission-set-arn '<Permission Set ARN>'
--managed-policy-arn 'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/PowerUserAccess'
