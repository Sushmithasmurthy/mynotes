Config Sync Advantages:
1. Reduce the risk of "shadow ops", where unvetted changes are pushed to live clusters and it is difficult to understand the differences between documented configuration and your live environment.
2. Use a "revert then investigate" strategy to roll back breaking changes and get your live clusters back into a good working state before fixing the problematic change and applying it as a new commit. This strategy reduces downtime due to configuration-related outages.

----Config Sync Operator----
1. Config Sync Operator - Config Sync synchronizes the states of your clusters with your Git repository. The Config Sync Operator custom controller monitors your Git repository and the states of your clusters, keeping them consistent for each Kubernetes object you choose. If Config Sync Operator fails to apply changes to a resource, the resource is left in the last known good state.
2. Config Sync can configure a single cluster or multiple clusters from a single Git repository.
