**Overview of VPC Service Controls**
VPC Service Controls enables broader context-based perimeter security, including controlling data egress across the perimeter.

For all Google Cloud services secured with VPC Service Controls, you can ensure that:

1. Resources within a perimeter are accessed only from clients within authorized VPC networks using Private Google Access with either Google Cloud or on-premises.

2. Clients within a perimeter that have private access to resources do not have access to unauthorized (potentially public) resources outside the perimeter.

3. Data cannot be copied to unauthorized resources outside the perimeter using service operations such as gsutil cp or bq mk.

4. When enabled, internet access to resources within a perimeter is restricted using whitelisted IPv4 and IPv6 ranges.
