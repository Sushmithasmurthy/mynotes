Highlights:

1. This focus on **stretching your ability** and **receiving immediate feedback** provides the core of a more universal
   principle—one that I increasingly came to believe provides the key to successfully acquiring career capital in almost
   any field.
2. In Outliers, Gladwell pointed to this rule as evidence that great accomplishment is not about natural talent, but
   instead about being in the right place at the right time to accumulate such a massive amount of practice.
3. if you just show up and work hard, you’ll soon hit a performance plateau beyond which you fail to get any better.
4. To successfully adopt the craftsman mindset, therefore, we have to approach our jobs in the same way that Jordan
   approaches his guitar playing or Garry Kasparov his chess training—with a dedication to deliberate practice.
5. The other thing I noticed about Alex is that this learning is not done in isolation: “You need to be constantly
   soliciting feedback from colleagues and professionals,”
6. The important stuff still finds its way to him, but on his schedule.
7. Doing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that’s exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice
   demands…. Deliberate practice is above all an effort of focus and concentration. That is what makes it “deliberate,”
   as distinct from the mindless playing of scales or hitting of tennis balls that most people engage in.
8. This is what you should experience in your own pursuit of “good.” If you’re not uncomfortable, then you’re probably
   stuck at an “acceptable level.”
9. Results-Only Work Environment (or, ROWE, for short). In a ROWE company, all that matters is your results. When you
   show up to work and when you leave, when you take vacations, and how often you check e-mail are all irrelevant. They
   leave it to the employee to figure out whatever works best for getting the important things done. “No results, no
   job: It’s that simple,”
