* Extreme reliability comes at a cost 
* We should strive to make a service reliable enough, but no more reliable than it needs to be
* Inefficient queuing is often a cause if high tail latency
* Google SRE’s unofficial motto is "Hope is not a strategy."
* It’s the solution to managing tool sprawl -> For instance, App A might use an ADC from Vendor X while App B (which fails to comply with any security standards) might use the same ADC but a previous version of code that is insecure, or perhaps a totally different ADC from Vendor Y, and all of sudden you add tool sprawl to the mix too.
* A simple average can obscure these **tail latencies**, hence most metrics are better thought of as **distributions** rather than averages.
* we want to spend time on long-term engineering project work instead of operational work. Because the term operational work may be misinterpreted, we use a specific word: toil.There are also administrative chores that have to get done, but should not be categorized as toil: this is overhead. Overhead is often work not directly tied to running a production service, and includes tasks like team meetings, setting and grading goals,19 snippets,20 and HR paperwork. Grungy work can sometimes have long-term value, and in that case, it’s not toil, either. Cleaning up the entire alerting configuration for your service and removing clutter may be grungy, but it’s not toil.****
* Effective alerting systems have good signal and very low noise.
